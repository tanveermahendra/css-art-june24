                <h1>Why was June made?— <br />Can you guess?</h1>
                <p>June was made for happiness! <br />
                    Even the trees<br />
                    Know this, and the breeze<br />
                    That loves to play<br />
                    In the sun all day,<br />
                    And never is too bold or rough,<br />
                    Like a child's laugh, a tiny bellow, a gentle puff;<br>
                    And all the fields know<br />
                    This is so—<br />
                    June was not made for wind and stress,<br />
                    June was made for happiness;<br />
                    Little happy tulips dance,<br />
                    And the meadow chants,<br />
                    ACalling out when I pass,<br />
                    "Read and rest here in the grass."<br />
                    June was made for happy things,<br />
                    Stories that rhyme to chirping birds whose wings,<br />
                    Flap not in rain or stress,<br />
                    June was made for happiness! <br />
                    <br />
