                <h1>Why was June made?— <br />Can you guess?</h1>
                <p>June was made for happiness! <br />
                    Even the trees<br />
                    Know this, and the breeze<br />
                    That loves to play<br />
                    Outside all day,<br />
                    And never is too bold or rough,<br />
                    Like March's wind, but just a tiny blow's enough;<br>
                    And all the fields know<br />
                    This is so—<br />
                    June was not made for wind and stress,<br />
                    June was made for happiness;<br />
                    Little happy daisy faces<br />
                    Show it in the meadow places,<br />
                    And they call out when I pass,<br />
                    "Stay and play here in the grass."<br />
                    June was made for happy things,<br />
                    Boats and flowers, stars and wings,<br />
                    Not for wind and stress,<br />
                    June was made for happiness! <br />
                    <br />
